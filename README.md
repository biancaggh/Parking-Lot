# Parking-Lot

Request:

Implement a parking lot management app in Java, that can generate tickets for vehicle owners based on the available spots. The parking lot can accept for parking motorcycles, cars and trucks. The parking spots are of three different sizes: small, medium and large. A regular user can park a motorcycle on a small spot, a car on a medium spot and a truck on the large one. A VIP user can park its vehicle on a bigger spot also if there are no available spots for that vehicle category.
